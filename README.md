# COGS-189-Final-Project

This is the final project I completed for COGS 189, which is a course on brain computer interface. Our project focused on analyzing how music affects one's ability to retain information. To collect our data, we used a Neurosky headset, which records an individual's meditation score. To learn more about our project checck out this video explaining our methods, procedure, and findings.
